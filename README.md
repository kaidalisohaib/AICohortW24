## Problem Statement
Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. Early detection can potentially save lives. We aim to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators, contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Collect Data**
   - [x] Download the dataset from Kaggle.
   - [ ] Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
   - [ ] Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - [ ] Encode categorical variables.
   - [ ] Normalize or scale numerical features.
   - [ ] Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Visualize Data**
   - [ ] Create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore the distribution of features.
   - [ ] Generate correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables.
   - [ ] Analyze trends and patterns in the data.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - [ ] Create new features based on domain knowledge.
   - [ ] Select relevant features for modeling.
   - [ ] Perform dimensionality reduction if necessary.

### Step 3: Model Building and Evaluation
1. **Model Selection**
   - [ ] Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task.
   - [ ] Train baseline models with default parameters.

2. **Model Evaluation**
   - [ ] Evaluate models using cross-validation and appropriate metrics.
   - [ ] Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

### Step 4: Model Deployment and Documentation
1. **Deploy Model**
   - [ ] Deploy the trained model to a web service or application.

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Document the project's methodology, findings, and conclusions in a report.
   - [ ] Write README files with instructions for running the code and reproducing results.
   - [ ] Create API documentation if applicable.
