                        Our team, a mix of curious minds from Vanier College, embarked on a remarkable adventure:
                        using
                        AI to
                        fight
                        against the ever-present threat of heart disease. While one teammate brought some experience
                        with Python
                        and a
                        taste of the exciting world of AI, the rest of us - two science enthusiasts, one
                        specializing in
                        health
                        sciences, and another diving into computer science and mathematics - were driven by a
                        powerful
                        combination of
                        curiosity and the desire to learn and contribute through teamwork.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were all eager to explore this uncharted territory, excited to understand how AI could be
                        used for
                        good, and
                        passionate about leaving a positive impact on the world.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Our first mission on this AI adventure was to hunt down some data. We scoured the web,
                        places
                        like
                        Kaggle, for
                        publicly available datasets related to healthcare or finance. The goal? Find the building
                        blocks
                        for our
                        machine
                        learning model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, the data gods smiled upon us! As we were digging, we stumbled upon a goldmine: a
                        dataset
                        specifically
                        focused on heart disease patients. Even better, this dataset was already prepped and
                        polished -
                        minimal
                        cleaning
                        needed! Unlike other datasets we'd seen, this one was free of missing pieces,
                        inconsistencies,
                        or
                        formatting
                        headaches. No wrestling with messy data for us! This lucky find meant we could skip the data
                        cleaning
                        grind and
                        head straight into understanding the dataset and building our cool model.

                    <p>
                        Our journey began by taking a deep dive into the heartbreaking impact of heart disease
                        worldwide. We
                        learned
                        about its alarmingly high prevalence, the risk factors that contribute to it, and the
                        immense
                        burden it
                        places
                        on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. This understanding fueled our passion to
                        explore the
                        potential
                        of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in tackling this critical issue.

                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        Our team was a diverse mix of individuals with varying levels of experience in AI and
                        programming.
                        Recognizing
                        this, I, with my prior knowledge, took on the role of a supportive guide to facilitate the

                        for
                        everyone. I directed the team towards a series of engaging video tutorials covering the
                        essentials:
                        Python
                        programming, scikit-learn, and Git & GitHub Desktop. These resources served a dual purpose:
                        providing a
                        solid
                        foundation in these crucial topics and equipping us with the necessary tools for seamless
                        collaboration
                        and
                        efficient version control.

                    <p>
                        To further unravel the mysteries within the dataset, we actively participated in our AI
                        cohort
                        workshop
                        sessions. Through interactive exercises and thought-provoking discussions, we gained
                        valuable
                        insights
                        into

                    <h3 id="item-2-4">Unveiling a Bias</h3>
                    <hr>

                    <p>
                        However, during our data exploration, we stumbled upon a critical challenge: the dataset
                        exhibited class
                        imbalance. This means that for our binary classification problem (predicting the presence or
                        absence of
                        heart
                        disease), a whopping 90% of the data belonged to the "no heart disease" class (target value
                        of
                        0.0),
                        while
                        only
                        10% belonged to the "heart disease" class (target value of 1.0). This uneven distribution
                        presented a
                        potential
                        roadblock, as our model might perform less effectively in identifying positive cases (heart
                        disease) due
                        to
                        its
                        overexposure to negative examples. Recognizing this bias early on allowed us to strategize
                        mitigation
                        techniques
                        and ensure a more robust and reliable model.

                    <h3 id="item-3-3">Iterative Experimentation</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Our approach wasn't static, but rather an iterative dance. We
                        experimented with different parameters, fine-tuning our models to achieve optimal performance.
                        This
                        involved adjusting hyperparameters, exploring feature engineering techniques like Polynomial
                        Features, and meticulously assessing the impact on model efficacy.

                        As responsible data scientists, we understood the importance of robust
                        evaluation metrics. Beyond traditional accuracy measures, we delved into metrics like precision,
                        recall, and balanced accuracy to gain deeper insights into our model's performance.

                        Visualizing the model's performance and interpreting its
                        predictions were integral parts of our process. We constructed Precision-Recall curves to
                        evaluate
                        the trade-off between precision and recall and gain insights into model behavior across
                        different
                        thresholds.

                        After a thorough evaluation and comparison, we identified the most promising models
                        for further analysis. Our selection criteria were based on a holistic assessment, considering
                        not
                        only accuracy but also recall, precision, and the area under the Precision-Recall curve (PR
                        AUC).

                    <p>
                        Recognizing the importance of reproducibility and scalability, we saved our
                        trained models in the ONNX format. This format ensures compatibility across different platforms
                        and
                        environments, facilitating seamless integration into real-world applications.

                    <hr>

                    Like mastering any skill, building an ML model requires evaluation and refinement. We used
                    metrics
                    like
                    accuracy, precision, and recall to assess our model's performance. Iteratively refining the
                    model
                    involved
                    tweaking parameters, adjusting pre-processing techniques, and exploring alternative algorithms.

                    <hr>

                    As our understanding of AI deepened, so did our awareness of ethical considerations. We learned
                    about the
                    potential biases embedded in data and algorithms, leading to unfair results. To address this, we
                    carefully
                    selected our initial data source and implemented bias mitigation techniques during model
                    training.
                    Transparency
                    and continuous monitoring were emphasized to ensure fairness and responsibility.
