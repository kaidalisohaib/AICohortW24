            <h2>Our Journey:</h2>
            <p>
                Our team, a mix of curious minds from Vanier College, embarked on a remarkable adventure: using AI to
                fight
                against the ever-present threat of heart disease. While one teammate brought some experience with Python
                and a
                taste of the exciting world of AI, the rest of us - two science enthusiasts, one specializing in health
                sciences, and another diving into computer science and mathematics - were driven by a powerful
                combination of
                curiosity and the desire to learn and contribute through teamwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                We were all eager to explore this uncharted territory, excited to understand how AI could be used for
                good, and
                passionate about leaving a positive impact on the world.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                Our first mission on this AI adventure was to hunt down some data. We scoured the web, places like
                Kaggle, for
                publicly available datasets related to healthcare or finance. The goal? Find the building blocks for our
                machine
                learning model.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, the data gods smiled upon us! As we were digging, we stumbled upon a goldmine: a dataset
                specifically
                focused on heart disease patients. Even better, this dataset was already prepped and polished - minimal
                cleaning
                needed! Unlike other datasets we'd seen, this one was free of missing pieces, inconsistencies, or
                formatting
                headaches. No wrestling with messy data for us! This lucky find meant we could skip the data cleaning
                grind and
                head straight into understanding the dataset and building our cool model.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Understanding the Problem and Tools</h2>
            <h3>Heart Disease: A Global Foe</h3>

            <p>
                Our journey began by taking a deep dive into the heartbreaking impact of heart disease worldwide. We
                learned
                about its alarmingly high prevalence, the risk factors that contribute to it, and the immense burden it
                places
                on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. This understanding fueled our passion to explore the
                potential
                of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in tackling this critical issue.
            </p>

            <h3>Leveling Up Our Skills</h3>

            <p>
                Our team was a diverse mix of individuals with varying levels of experience in AI and programming.
                Recognizing
                this, I, with my prior knowledge, took on the role of a supportive guide to facilitate the learning
                process
                for
                everyone. I directed the team towards a series of engaging video tutorials covering the essentials:
                Python
                programming, scikit-learn, and Git & GitHub Desktop. These resources served a dual purpose: providing a
                solid
                foundation in these crucial topics and equipping us with the necessary tools for seamless collaboration
                and
                efficient version control.
            </p>

            <h3>Delving Deep into the Data</h3>

            <p>
                To further unravel the mysteries within the dataset, we actively participated in our AI cohort workshop
                sessions. Through interactive exercises and thought-provoking discussions, we gained valuable insights
                into
                data
                visualization techniques, descriptive statistics, and pattern identification. These exploratory
                endeavors
                allowed us to peel back the layers of the dataset, laying a strong foundation for the analysis and model
                development stages that lay ahead.
            </p>

            <h3>Unveiling a Bias</h3>

            <p>
                However, during our data exploration, we stumbled upon a critical challenge: the dataset exhibited class
                imbalance. This means that for our binary classification problem (predicting the presence or absence of
                heart
                disease), a whopping 90% of the data belonged to the "no heart disease" class (target value of 0.0),
                while
                only
                10% belonged to the "heart disease" class (target value of 1.0). This uneven distribution presented a
                potential
                roadblock, as our model might perform less effectively in identifying positive cases (heart disease) due
                to
                its
                overexposure to negative examples. Recognizing this bias early on allowed us to strategize mitigation
                techniques
                and ensure a more robust and reliable model.

        <strong>### STOPPED HERE, NEED TO CONTINUE EXPLAINING</strong>
        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: Building and Training our Model</h2>

            Armed with clean data and basic scikit-learn knowledge, we ventured into model building. We experimented
            with
            various ML algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to predict heart disease presence.
            Training our chosen model involved feeding it prepared data, allowing it to learn complex relationships
            between
            factors and heart disease.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 4: Evaluation and Refinement</h2>

            Like mastering any skill, building an ML model requires evaluation and refinement. We used metrics like
            accuracy, precision, and recall to assess our model's performance. Iteratively refining the model involved
            tweaking parameters, adjusting pre-processing techniques, and exploring alternative algorithms.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 5: Ethical Considerations</h2>

            As our understanding of AI deepened, so did our awareness of ethical considerations. We learned about the
            potential biases embedded in data and algorithms, leading to unfair results. To address this, we carefully
            selected our initial data source and implemented bias mitigation techniques during model training.
            Transparency
            and continuous monitoring were emphasized to ensure fairness and responsibility.
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 6: Conclusion and Future Steps</h2>

            This project has been a profound learning experience. We transitioned from novices to proficient users of
            Python, scikit-learn, and ML concepts. More importantly, we recognized the transformative potential of AI in
            healthcare and the importance of responsible development. Moving forward, we are eager to explore advanced
            AI
            techniques, delve deeper into healthcare data analysis, and advocate for ethical AI solutions to benefit
            society.
